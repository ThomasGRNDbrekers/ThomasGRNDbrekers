Hey there, I'm Thomas! 👋
Welcome to my corner of GitHub, where I'm all about making things happen. I go by the title of "projectmeewerker" at JC Bouckenborgh, and my current mission is nothing short of exciting – building a thriving makerspace known as #GRNDbrekers. You'll find us nestled in the attic of a castle, surrounded by the tranquility of a park.

What's #GRNDbrekers, you ask?
#GRNDbrekers is not your run-of-the-mill project; it's a creative haven where imagination knows no bounds. Our mission is to foster innovation and hands-on learning through a variety of open sessions, workshops, class series, and exciting activities. While our main focus is on nurturing the talents of young minds aged 16 to 30, we're thrilled to welcome enthusiasts of all ages, from 10 to 99!

About Me
As for me, I'm a self-taught "maker" who's constantly expanding my skillset. I'm modest about it, though, as my talents may not be the most extensive or deeply specialized, but I firmly believe that we're all perpetual learners. Every day brings a new opportunity to acquire new knowledge and hone my craft.

Beyond the Code
While I'm passionate about the world of making and creating, I've also invested a significant chunk of my time in volunteer work for youth organizations and youth services. There's something deeply rewarding about giving back and empowering the next generation.

And yes, I'm a sports enthusiast through and through. Don't be surprised if you catch me cheering for a game of darts – because yes, darts is indeed a sport!

So, feel free to explore my GitHub and join me on this journey of making, creating, and giving back. Let's connect, collaborate, and build something awesome together! 🚀✨

P.S. If you're in the neighborhood, drop by #GRNDbrekers and let's create some magic together! 🏰🔨🎨
